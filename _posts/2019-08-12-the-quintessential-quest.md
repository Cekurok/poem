### The quintessential quest


Abandoned, Abashed and Ablazed,  
Standing forlorn, retrospecting,  
What could have been a easy journey,  
I made it difficult, always this deep,  
introverted emotion wanted more,  
than just food, money and glory.  
  
Barbed, Baggy and Battered,  
My heart just throbbed, with,  
fear of missing out, not fear,  
of failure, throbbed with,  
with my inadequacies, it,  
restricted my breath, vision blurred.  
  
Cavalier, Capitalist and Cautionary  
The mind, in which I spend so much,  
of my time, It just wanted peace,  
It just wanted to keep me safe,  
It wanted to put me in a pursuit,  
a pursuit of comfort and happiness.  
  
In a chest deep of sludge, and,  
disappointment, with so bare,  
breaths and vision, with ping-ponging,  
heart and brain, the soul knew,  
It had to burn and tear itself apart, to, go  
on and continue on one last,  
but the quintessential quest.
