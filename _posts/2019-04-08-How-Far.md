### How far can you go ?

How far can you go,  
In this demonish world,  
Reeking of sweat,  
Which you bled today.  
  
How long can you love,  
When your heart is melting,  
With the flames that,  
burst out today.  

### PS

I would like to add some more para but that's it for now.
  
### That's all folks.
