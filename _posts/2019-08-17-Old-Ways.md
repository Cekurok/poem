### Old Ways

Looking into a human’s eyes,  
Trying to look at someone’s soul,  
I read somewhere, eyes mirror soul.  
Like an acceptable insane,  
Old ways die hard.  
There is an Epiphany,   
A real human connection,  
If it doesn’t amaze you,  
There is still meaning left,  
The power with which it strikes,  
There will be just one thing left to say,  
Is it better to speak or die?
