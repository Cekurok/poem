### Montage

Put together pieces of your dreams,  
Dreams which you saw,  
Some of which fulfilled,   
Some of which remain afar,  
Some you are yet to see.  
  
Put together pieces of memories,  
Some of which you forgot,  
Some of which is broken,  
Some of which is clear,  
Some you are yet to make.  
  
Put together pieces of your life,  
Some of which bitter,  
Some of which stale,  
Some of which sweet,  
Some yet to experience.  
  
Put together pieces of your heart,  
Broken by people,  
Broken at times,  
Shattered on Stairs,  
Splattered on floors.  
  
Put together pieces of your soul,  
and your body,  
Which you have lost in time,  
Which you have in present,  
And Which you are yet to see.  

Write a montage,  
brimming with life,  
put together every piece,  
you have collected,  
Which sings you a tune,  
Not necessarily something,  
you want to hear,  
But which gives you hope,  
But which keeps you in life,  
But which smothers toxicity,  
But also,  
uplifts you in your dark days.  
  
Write a montage dear,  
take time to pick pieces,  
however small the pieces are,  
pick all of it,  
for people to come,  
for you to come,  
or you will forget,  
like everything else.
