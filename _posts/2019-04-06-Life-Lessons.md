### Dreams

Have a dream, a big fat dream,  
When everyone is busy rescheduling,  
You will be pursuing something, something big.  
It’s not fantasy ride,  

It’s a hell ride, you know hell,  
But as you read,  
If you are going through hell,  
Keep going.  

Why bear all the pain and Dream Big,  
Why not just live a mediocre life,  
Why take a giant leap,you know,  
That’s controversial.  

It’s all upto you, you know  
what do you want,nothing is right or wrong  
But don’t you think it would be cool,  
to have a story of sweat, blood and fury.  

You can have a linear life,   
Like everyone else around,  
But you know,   
It’s all upto you.  

### Vulnerability

Everyone is vulnerable,  
Someone hides it well,  
Someone doesn’t.  

But it’s not one dimensional,  
Someone feels more,  
Someone doesn’t.  
  
Social etiquette is the second,  
Etiquette decides who will feel,  
more vulnerable, who doesn’t.  

Then there is friendship,  
Friends are like love, you know  
you get what you think you deserve  

Then there is you, you know you,  
you have a choice, everyone has,  
accept your vulnerability publicly,  
become better on it, then you chip back,  
power from everyone, and become empowered.  

And then there are rebels and non conformists,  
they feel vulnerable but they choose,  
you know to ignore.  
  
you will always have a choice,  
you know,  pick better ones.
  
### That's all folks.
