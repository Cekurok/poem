### Drumroll
(Take a breathe after each line, read it till end.)

Let me come close,  
Walk my hand up yours,  
Let it rest, up your jaw,  
Let it stay there,  
for a moment, and some more,  
With my fingers,  
creeping up your cheeks  
and commissure,  
Let me bring you close,  
Share a breath, some more,  
Come closer, closer,  
Share the heartbeats,  
Can you listen mine,  
Can you listen, listen yours,  
Are you just deafounded,  
Sway away, But… Sway  
Slowly,  
Farther and Farther,  
Sway in, But…. Sway  
Slowly,  
Closer, and Closer,  
Can you feel the chills,  
rising from the basal,  
and slowly,  
Sneaking up your temple,  
Let’s just take a moment,  
of absolute stillness,  
and enamour the intimacy,  
Let’s,  
just for a moment,  
and more,  
Hold our breath,  
Shh!, Just hold,  
Do you feel the beats,  
the rising beats,  
the vigour of your heart,  
and mine,  
Do you feel your blood,  
racing against breath,  
Do you feel desperate for air,  
But Do you feel alive,  
more alive, more awake,  
Before we break,  
Are the moments,  
we feel most alive,  
Let’s break together,  
Let’s disintegrate,  
And weave ourselves,  
with eternity,  
for eternity,  
Let’s save selves from salvation,  
& transcend the world,  
& it’s karma,  
& be there,  
with eternity,  
for eternity,  
I know my love,  
of you is selfish,  
but that’s the only way,  
only way I have known,  
I know my love,  
of you is selfish,  
but I don’t regret,  
loving you,  
like this,  
with eternity,  
for eternity.  

### Story behind this.
This isn't written keeping any particular person in mind. I had a complaint about my poems, that they are not deep enough, that they aren't capable of making someone feel something, so this poem is me crossing that barrier. I know for a fact that this poem will make you feel something(if you read without judgement and don't find it cheesy), whichever part of the world you live. Hope you share it with your loved ones.
