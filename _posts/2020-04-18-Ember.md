## Ember

And there she was,  
the Ember girl,  
Dryad put to flames.  
There is light,  
but how far,  
how far will she go,  
like a ball of paint,  
farther she goes,  
less there is to,  
go farther,  
Sand burns,  
Steam Whispers,  
to glass,  
of uprising,  
farther she goes,  
less there is to,  
in secrecy,  
Like whispers,  
as they were,  
lost in,  
with it,  
is lost,  
the light,  
of stars,  
Like embers,  
as they were,  
silenced,  
with it,  
is lost,  
the light,  
of stars,  
farther she goes,  
less there is to,  
Lost Whispers,  
Silent Embers,  
Are forgotten,  
But Light survives,  
to tell a story,  
Of Embers who,  
fought together,  
If there was a,  
infinity,  
She could have,  
walked,  
She would have,  
But She Danced,  
She Danced,  
till Eternity,  
She was a,  
a phoenix,  
meant to rise,  
from her ashes,  
giving birth,  
to a new dryad,  
Again put to flames,  
Destined for pain,  
Destined was her,  
was her light,  
to tell stories,  
She was a,  
a phoenix,  
meant to rise,  
Ashes,  
were silenced,  
Like Embers,  
A breeze they,  
couldn’t withstand,  
They stayed,  
there in Chastity,  
aloof from grime,  
Waiting for,  
more and more,  
to come together,  
To Bring her back,  
When they did,  
She wasn’t alone,  
She was a star,  
And with her,  
were 1729 more,  
And how the space was,  
Light came back,  
Even if embers are silenced,  
Light survives,  
You can put her,  
to flames,  
But that’s all.
