### A whore's night


I rolled down, like hazel fell in love,  
Slowly then all at once;  
  
I rolled when,   
Someone died a thousand death,  
Walking someone else’s path;  
  
I rolled when,  
That someone ranted,  
As if it was not his own fucking choice;  
  
I rolled when,  
That someone walked his own path,  
And abandoned when path got tough;  
  
I rolled down, like mothball catches fire,  
Slowly then all at once;  
  
I rolled when,  
When a girl realized,  
She has to be a women;  
  
I rolled when,  
A man realized that,  
he is bereft of something loved;  
  
I rolled when,  
That man got tangled,  
With old beautiful memories;  
  
I rolled when,  
Someone realized,  
Everyone there has lost a part;  
  
I rolled when,   
Someone remembered,  
The warm comfort of lap;  
  
I rolled when,  
Someone saw someone,  
sleeping in fetal position;  
  
I rolled when,  
Someone held hands,  
And then they both realised;  
  
We roll down,  
We are tears,  
We are cheap,  
like a whore’s night.
